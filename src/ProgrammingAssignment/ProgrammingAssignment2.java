Create a program that calculates the y value of a linear equation given the slope (m), the x value,
and the y-intercept (b) in the following equation: y=mx+b. The user will enter the values of the
slope, the x value, and the y-intercept. The program will then determine the value of y using the
equation. This program should display the computed value of y.
